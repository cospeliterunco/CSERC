			<p> 
			The Colorado Springs Elite Running Coalition was formed with the mission of providing elite runners in Colorado Springs with the support network needed to compete at the national and international levels. 
			<br><br>
			Though most of these runners either grew in Colorado, attended school in Colorado or now reside and train in Colorado Springs they represent over a half-dozen countries. 
			<br><br>
			We believe that by intentionally combining resources, training, sponsors and connections in the sport that individuals can thrive and come closer to achieving their potential.
